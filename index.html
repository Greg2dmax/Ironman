            <h3>Here's a few things about Mr.Stark Life :</h3>
  <p>Young Tony Stark was a prodigy of mechanical engineering genius. At 21, he took over his father's company and launched it into a hugely successful corporation. During a testing of new technology in Vietnam, Tony was hit by a piece of shrapnel from a booby trap. The shrapnel was lodged near his heart and without help, Tony would die</p>

            <p>Tony is still human, with the exception of an Arc Reactor in his chest. However, by the end of Iron Man 3, he has the shrapnel removed, no longer needing the arc reactor. Before the start of Avengers: Infinity War</p>

        <p>In order to stop Thanos once and for all, Tony sacrificed himself to use the Infinity Stones to disintegrate the Mad Titan and his army.</p>
